# Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN (MNIST)

## üìå Overview
A TensorFlow/Keras **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** that classifies handwritten digits (0‚Äì9) from the **MNIST** dataset loaded from CSV files. The script handles data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, visualization, prediction export, and model saving.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- Load & validate MNIST data from `train.csv` / `test.csv`
- Normalize & reshape to `(28, 28, 1)` tensors
- One‚Äëhot encode labels
- Split training/validation (80/20)
- Visualize class distribution & sample images
- CNN with 3 conv‚Äëpool blocks + dense head + dropout
- EarlyStopping & ReduceLROnPlateau callbacks
- Accuracy & loss training curves
- Confusion matrix + classification report
- Random sample predictions with confidence
- Export `predictions.csv`
- Save trained model (`digit_recognition_model.h5`)
- Generate performance summary

## üèó Model Architecture
```
Input: 28x28x1
Conv2D(32,3x3) + ReLU + MaxPool
Conv2D(64,3x3) + ReLU + MaxPool
Conv2D(128,3x3) + ReLU + MaxPool
Flatten
Dense(128) + ReLU
Dropout(0.5)
Dense(10) + Softmax
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements
Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

---

## üìÇ Data Format
Your CSVs must follow the Kaggle MNIST digit-recognizer style:

**train.csv**
- 785 columns total: `label` + 784 pixel values (`pixel0`..`pixel783`)
- One row per 28x28 image

**test.csv**
- 784 pixel columns; optional `label` column (if present, evaluation will include metrics)

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/digit-recognition-cnn.git
cd digit-recognition-cnn

# Place train.csv and test.csv in this folder

python digit_recognition_cnn.py
```

---

## üìä What You Get After Running
Output artifacts (created in the project folder):
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `predictions.csv` | ImageId ‚Üí predicted digit for test set |
| `digit_recognition_model.h5` | Saved trained Keras model |
| Training plots | Accuracy & loss curves (displayed; save manually if needed) |
| Confusion matrix | Displayed heatmap; save manually if needed |

---

## üîß Configuration Tips
You can edit defaults in **`digit_recognition_cnn.py`**:
- Change file names in `load_and_preprocess_data()`
- Adjust validation split percentage
- Modify CNN layers or dropout
- Set training `epochs` in `train_model()`
- Tune callback patience or min LR

---

## üöÄ Ideas to Extend
- Data augmentation (random shifts/rotations)
- Learning rate schedulers / optimizer experiments
- Batch normalization layers
- Model quantization / TFLite export
- Simple Gradio or Streamlit demo app
